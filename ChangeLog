2007-01-16 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Release version 1.27

2007-01-16 Sebastien Tandel <sebastien, at, tandel (doht) be)
	* Cleaned up code for patch handling, fix bug in subdir handling,
	  include patch info in help.

2007-01-15 Steve Kemp <steve at shellcode dot org>
	* Fix Debian bug #268236.
	  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=268236
	  This complains that flawfinder crashes when presented with a
	  file it cannot read.  The patch obviously can't prevent
	  the problem, since the tool can't review what it can't read,
	  but at least it halts with a cleaner error message.

2007-01-15 cmorgan <cmorgan47, at earthlink dooot net>
	* Fixed Debian bug #271287 (flawfinder).  See:
 	   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271287
	  Fixed skipping newlines when line ended with \,
	  which caused incorrect line number reporting.
	  Skip multiple whitespace at one time.

2007-01-15 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Modified Sebastien Tandel's code so that it also supports GNU diff
	  (his code worked only for svn diff)
	* When using a patchfile, skip analysis of any file not
	  listed in the patchfile.

2007-01-15 Sebastien Tandel <sebastien, at, tandel (doht) be)
	* Add support for using "svn diff" created patch files, based
	  on the approach described by David A. Wheeler on how it
	  could be done.

2007-01-15 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* By default, now skips directories beginning with "."
	  (this makes it work nicely with many SCM systems).
	  Added "--followdotdir" option if you WANT it to enter
	  such directories.
	* Fixed divide-by-zero when no code found (not exactly common
	  in normal use, but anyway!)

2004-06-15 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.26.
	* NOTE: Due to an error on my part,
	  the tar file for version 1.25 was for a short period
	  (after 2004-06-05) actually version 1.26,
	  incorrectly labelled as 1.25.
	  My sincere apologies!!  Please upgrade to 1.26, since that
	  way you'll be SURE to get the right version.

2004-06-04 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Reviewed and modified Jared's code somewhat, and added
	  support for _TEXT() as well as _T().
	  See http://www.rpi.edu/~pudeyo/articles/unicode.html for more info
	  on Microsoft's approach to internationalization involving TCHAR.
	* Wrote ChangeLog entries for Jared's code.

2004-06-04 Jared Robinson (jarrob, at, symantec.com)
	* Added more support for Microsoft's approach to internationalization.
	  Thus, it accepts _T() just like gettext(), and adds many more
	  functions: _getts(), vswprintf(), _stprintf(), _vstprintf(),
	  vwprintf(), vfwprintf(), _vtprintf(), _ftprintf(), _vftprintf(),
	  _sntprintf(), _vsntprintf(), _ftscanf(), _gettc().
	  In this approach, TCHAR and various macros are typically used.
	  In particular, _T() of tchar.h converts character strings
	  to long character strings, if _UNICODE is defined
	  (this makes TCHAR a long 16-bit character). Thus, T() is:
	  #ifdef _UNICODE
	  #define _T(x) L ## x
	  #else
	  #define _T(x) x
	  #endif

2004-06-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Added two new rules for GLib functions,
	  "g_get_home_dir" and "g_get_tmp_dir", per a suggestion by
	  Steve Kemp, lead of the Debian Security Auditing Project.
	  This closes the wishlist item in Debian bug report #250432
	  (see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=250432).
	  Contributors - please email wishlist items to me;
	  I can't monitor every distribution's local bug tracking system.
	  PLEASE tell upstream developers when there's a bug/wishlist
	  item, we can't fix it if we don't know.
	* Added curl_getenv().  Kemp's suggestion reminded me to search
	  for other getenv()-like functions, and that one popped up.
	* Added several rules for input functions (for -I) -
	  recv, recvfrom, recvmsg, fread, and readv.
	* Tightened the false positive test slightly; if a name is
	  followed by = or - or + it's unlikely to be a function call,
	  so it'll be quietly discarded.
	* Modified the summary report format slightly.
	* Modified the getpass text to remove an extraneous character,
	  thanks to a bug report from Joerg Beyer (job, at, webde-ag.de)
	* Modified installation instructions to clarify how to set
	  INSTALL_DIR at run-time so it installs elsewhere.
	  It uses the standard GNU conventions, but not everyone
	  knows about them. By default, it installs in /usr/local.
	  Just use normal make overrides to change that, e.g.,
	  make INSTALL_DIR=/usr INSTALL_DIR_MAN=/usr/share/man install
	  I do NOT use the ?= macro-setting commands in the makefile,
	  because that's not standard (e.g., it's not in SUSv3), so
	  while that would work in GNU make, it wouldn't work in others.

2004-05-31 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.25.


2004-05-30 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Added more rules for finding problems by examining the
	  Red Hat Linux 9 documentation (the man3 man pages),
	  looking for phrases like "do not use", "security", and "obsolete".
	  Thus, added rules for
	  cuserid, getlogin, getpass, mkstemp, getpw, memalign, as
	  well as the obsolete functions gsignal, ssignal, ulimit, usleep.
	* Modified text for strncat to clarify it.
	  My thanks to Christian Biere, christianbiere, at, gmx.de, for
	  reporting the problem.
	* Added lengthy text to the manual to explain exactly how to use
	  flawfinder with vim and emacs.  This should also help
	  integrate flawfinder into other text editors/IDEs.
	* Fixed error in --columns format, so that the output is simply
	  "filename:linenumber:columnnumber" when --columns (-C) is used.
	* Eliminated "Number of" phrase in the footer report
	  (it was redundant anyway)
	* Added more statistical information to the footer report.
	* Changed makefile to simplify running tests.
	* Tests now autogenerate html and txt versions.
	* Added shortcut single-letter commands (-D for --dataonly,
	  -Q for --quiet, -C for --columns), so that invoking from
	  editors is easier.
	* Tries to autoremove some false positives.  In particular, a function
	  name followed immediately by "=" (ignoring whitespace)
	  is automatically considered to be a variable and NOT a function,
	  and thus doesn't register as a hit.  There are exotic cases
	  where this won't be correct, but they're pretty unlikely in
	  real code.
	* Added a "--falsepositive" (-F) option, which tries to remove
	  many more likely false positives.  The current heuristic is:
	  if -F is enabled, any function name must be
	  followed by "(" (ignoring whitespace) to be considered a
	  possible hit; otherwise, it's thrown away.
	  Thus, if you often use variable names that are
	  also the names of risky functions, like "access", you
	  might consider using this option.  Note that flawfinder
	  uses simple lexical analysis; eliminating many more false positives
	  would require deeper code analysis
	  (to examine type information, buffer size declarations, etc.).
	  This option also disables reporting of static character
	  buffer arrays.
	  This -F option and the autoremoving of false positives above is
	  in response to a problem report from
	  Mike Ruscher (Mike.Ruscher, at, cse-cst.gc.ca),
	  though the approach and code is my own.  This may not completely
	  solve Mr. Ruscher's problem, but it's a start.
	* Documented that flawfinder output can be misunderstood if
	  there are source filenames whose names contain newline, linefeed, or
	  colon.  Source filenames shouldn't have such characters anyway;
	  while flawfinder can handle them, many other tools can't.
	* Modified the documentation to make it clear in the synopsis
	  which one-letter flags are short for which long names.
	* Modified "make install" script slightly so that it creates
	  directories that don't yet exist when installing.
	  My thanks to Joerg Beyer (job, at webde-ag.de) for reporting
	  the problem and suggesting a solution.
	  This solution requires that "mkdir" support the "-p" option,
	  which shouldn't be a problem for nearly all users.

2003-10-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.24.
	* Fixed an incredibly obscure parsing error that caused some
	  false positives.  If a constant C string, after the closing
	  double-quote, is followed by a \ and newline (instead of a comma),
	  the string might not be recognized as a constant string
	  (thus triggering warnings about non-constant values in some cases).
	  This kind of formatting is quite ugly and rare.
	  My thanks to Sascha Nitsch (sascha, at spsn.ath.cx) for pointing
	  this bug out and giving me a test case to work with.
	* Added a warning for readlink.  The implementation and warning
	  are mine, but the idea of warning about readlink came from
	   Stefan Kost (kost, at imn.htwk-leipzig.de).  Thanks!!

2003-09-27 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.23.  Minor bugfixes.

2003-09-27 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed subtle bug - in some circumstances single character constants
	  wouldn't be parsed correctly.  My thanks to Scott Renfro
	  (scottdonotspam, at, renfro.org) for notifying me about this bug.
	  Scott Renfro also sent me a patch; I didn't use it
	  (the patch didn't handle other cases), but I'm grateful since it
	  illustrated the problem.
	* Fixed documentation bug in man page.
	  The option "--minlevel=X" must be preceded by two dashes,
	  as are all GNU-style long options. The man page accidentally only
	  had one dash in the summary (it was correct elsewhere); it now
	  correctly shows both dashes.
	* Modified man page to list filename extensions that are
	  interpreted as C/C++.
	* Removed index.html from distribution - it's really only for the
	  website.

2003-03-08 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.22.  Output format slightly changed (colon added),
	  so that it's compatible with tools that expect compiler warnings
	  in the typical format "filename:line-number: warning".
	  To get the fully expected format (all in one line), use "-S".
	  Also, improved RPM packaging.

2003-03-08 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Changed makefile to be consistent with new RPM packaging approach.
	* Changed makefile: now for testing, will automatically uninstall
	  old sloccount when creating rpm.  Also (for me), make my_install
	  works (well, it helps me anyway).

2003-02-01 Jose Pedro Oliveira
	* Improved RPM packaging.

2003-09-22 Jukka A. Ukkonen
	* Recommended an extra colon in the output format, so that the
	  output format would like like typical compiler output (and thus
	  more compatible with existing tools that report warnings).

2002-09-07 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.21, with the following changes:
	* Improved the default output so it creates multiple formatted lines
	  instead of single very long lines for each hit.
	  Use the new "--singleline" (-S) option to get the original
	  "long line" format.
	* Removed duplicate "getpass" entry in the ruleset;
	  this didn't hurt anything, but was unnecessary.
	  Thanks to the user who gave me that feedback, wish I'd kept your
	  email address so I could credit you properly :-).
	* Added a short tutorial to man page.
	* Fixed initial upper/lower case on many entries in the ruleset.
	* Allow "--input" as a synonym for "--inputs".

2002-07-07 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.20, with many more changes:
	* Entries have been added to the database to detect file openings and
	  static character array definitions.
	* The HTML format has been significantly improved.
	* Joerg Beyer provided several nice improvements to flawfinder,
	  including a timing report.
	* Now Flawfinder by default skips symbolic links,
	  and always skips special files, to counter attackers who
	  insert malicious files in their source code directories.
	* The documentation has been improved in various ways.

2002-07-05 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Completely rewrote the functions handling opening the
	  files/directories named on the command line and when
	  walking down the directory tree.  This was in part
	  to handle a new security requirement for source code web
	  hosting services, which may analyze code written by someone else
	  AND then send reports to someone else who doesn't have the
	  same rights to view files as the analysis program.
	  It's the last part that's different - the attacker may control
	  the code being analyzed and insert non-regular files or
	  symbolic links to "bad" files like /etc/passwd (to expose its
	  contents) or /dev/zero (to stall analysis).  These are
	  annoying but not really a problem when the analyst is running on
	  his OWN machine.
	  To deal with this, now flawfinder NEVER opens a file type that isn't
	  a file or directory, and it skips symbolic
	  links by default (though this can be changed),
	  no matter if they're listed at the top or inside
	  a directory descendent.  This is actually reasonable behavior
	  for everyone, since others may be analyzing programs
	  that they don't trust either.
	* Added open() and fopen() as entries, now it has 127 entries
	  in the database.  Modified test code to test it.
	* Warning messages about skipping symlinks and
	  files that aren't regular files are now controlled by --quiet
	  instead of --dataonly; since --quiet controls printing
	  status messages this seems more reasonable.
	* Changed the format of the HTML output - now it creates a list.
	  The ending is now in regular type, instead of <pre>...</pre>.
	  This seemed too look nicer.
	* Reworked Beyer's patch that prints speed somewhat, e.g., to print
	  floating point time (on small programs or fast machines
	  the time would be reported as "0") and to avoid
	  divide-by-zero on systems where time really is reported
	  as zero.
	* Added "--omittime", so that the regression test
	  results won't vary depending on the time the analysis takes.
	* Fixed minor bug: now the filename "-" works to mean
	  standard input.  This is rarely used, since usually files
	  are analyzed instead.
	* Modified documentation to make clear that in many circumstances
	  you need to copy the source code to a separate area.
	  I removed the reference to "--nolink", since this is now
	  the default.
	* Modified makefile to generate correct-results.html and
	  correct-results.txt, so that (1) there will be a standard
	  to compare with and (2) the web page has a demo.

2002-07-05 Joerg Beyer <job, at, webde-ag.de>
	* Tiny patch to report the number of lines analyzed and
	  the analysis speed in lines/second.

2002-07-04 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Changed Joerg Beyer's patch that gives a nicer error
	  message if an invalid option flag is given.  Now the patch
	  also works in Python 1.5.  This involved using getopt.error
	  instead of getopt.GetoptError.
	* Added a comment explicitly documenting that flawfinder
	  is written to run under both Python 1.5 and Python 2.
	  Lots of systems only include Python 1.5, or use Python 1.5
	  as the default Python (e.g., Red Hat 7.2).
	  Someday that won't be a concern, but there's no reason it
	  can't easily port between the two for a while.
	* Ran PyChecker and modified code to eliminate the errors it reports.

2002-07-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Changed the default to IGNORE symbolic links, and added the
	  --allowlink option to use symbolic links.  This is a safer default,
	  and few people will really want to follow symbolic links anyway.
	* Added option --dataonly to suppress headers and footers;
	  use this along with --quiet to get "just the facts"
	  (e.g., when processing the output with other tools).
	  This was inspired by a comment from A.T. Hofkamp.

2002-07-03 Joerg Beyer <job, at, webde-ag.de>
	* Various small patches - thanks!!  There were as follows:
	* If you call flawfinder without input,
	  state that there was no input, not state that there's no hit.
	* If interrupted with Control-C, flawfinder now prints cleanly
	  that it was interrupted.
	* Print a nicer error message if an invalid option flag
	  is given.
	* Just for completeness' sake, I'm including two of the patches:

2002-07-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Added detection of static arrays of char, wchar_t, and TCHAR.
	* Fixed typo in makefile uninstall script. My thanks to
	  Andrew Dalgleish for pointing this out.
	* Modified installation to be friendlier to Cygwin.  My thanks to
	  Andrew Dalgleish for pointing this out, too.
          One step involved creating PYTHONEXT in the makefile
	  and documenting it, which was no problem.
	  A more surprising problem was that the INSTALL file needed to
	  be renamed to "INSTALL.txt", because otherwise "make install"
	  thinks that everything is already installed.
	  This is a nasty problem caused by Windows' type insensitivity
	  conflicting with normal Unix standards... this should really
	  be noted somewhere in various standard documents!!
	  I eventually added a ".PHONY:" target to the makefile,
	  which also solves the problem when using GNU make.
	* Fixed ChangeLog - the 2002 dates were accidentally 2001.

2002-07-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Changed correct-results so that the version numbers are right.
	* Created "make test-is-correct" which moves the test results
	  into the "correct-results" file.

2002-07-02 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.01.
	* Bugfix: Programs with getopt() or getopt_long() could trigger
	  a problem with flawfinder itself.  Now fixed.
	* Added the --nolink option, and a detailed description in the
	  man page.  Basically, this foils attacks where malicious
	  programmers insert into their source tree symbolic links
	  to files like /etc/passwd or /dev/zero.
	  You still need to copy source code files into a separate area
	  if you are worried about malicious programmers; see the
	  new man page discussion about this.

2002-07-01 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 1.00, a major step forward.
	* I have significantly enlarged the database, from 55 rules
	  to 122 rules.  Making the database this large is such a
	  major improvement in its usefulness that I've bumped the
	  version number up to 1.00.  A number are from my book,
	  while others are suggested by "Writing Secure Code" by
	  Howard and LeBlanc (for the Windows-specific issues).
	* Added HTML generation support.
	* Significantly enlarged the test suite.

2002-5-6 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 0.22, a very minor improvement.
	* Modified the report about %s in scanf when a limit for %s
	  was provided; some found the error report very
	  confusing.  My thanks to Agustin.Lopez, who asked a question
	  that led me to this understanding.

2001-12-18 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 0.21.
	* Fixed an error in the database entry for syslog(3), which
	  would cause incorrect hits.  This resolves the Debian bug
	  "Bug#124009: flawfinder: wrong reports of format
	   fulnerabilities for syslog".
	* Added simple "INSTALL" file.
	* Fixed documentation, documenting --version and fixing a
	  format problem with "--neverignore".
	* I accidentally wrote over version 0.20 with version 0.21's
	  contents. Sigh.

2001-12-11 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 0.20.
	* Added --version, which prints JUST the version number without
	  actually analyzing any programs.

2001-11-08 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed MANIFEST.in to include "flawfinder.1*"; that way the
	  compressed man page is included when using MANIFEST.in.
	  Thanks to Jon Nelson for noting this.
	  The effect of this is quite tiny -
	  my tar file & rpm files already included the compressed
	  man page, so this error affects very few people.
	  Note also that this just meant that only the uncompressed
	  man page was in the MANIFEST, so I don't expect that this
	  error had any user-visible effects other than a few more K of man
	  page space (and with multi-Gigabyte drives, that's hard to notice).

2001-11-04 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 0.19
	* Fixed a minor bug - flawfinder didn't realize that multiline strings
	  passed to gettext() are still constant strings.
	  My thanks to "Arthur", who reported this bug, and
	  Adam Lazur (Debian) who passed it on to me.
	  This closes Debian Bug#118025.
	* Minor change - precomputed internationalization pattern for
	  a minor performance improvement.
	* Output a reminder that not all hits are actually security
	  vulnerabilities, as well as that there may be other vulnerabilities.
	  The documentation mentioned this too, but including that in
	  the output of the program makes it clearer (apparantly some
	  expect flawfinder to perform amazing magic far beyond the
	  possible).  I think ALL programs like this should include this
	  reminder; otherwise sane software developers somehow expect
	  programs like this to work miracles, instead of simply reporting
	  likely spots based on heuristics.

2001-11-03 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Added a "help" option and support for DistUtils, as well as
	  modification of the RPM spec file so it can be built by non-root.
	  My thanks to Jon Nelson for the patches to do this.
	* Added "syslog" to the vulnerability database.
	  My thanks to Dave Aitel for this contribution.
	* Generate and install compressed man page, rather than uncompressed.
	  My thanks to Marius Tomaschewski for this suggestion.

2001-10-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Released version 0.17.
	* Created an RPM package, to simplify installation.
	* Accepts RATS' "ignore" directive, as well as ITS4's, for
	  compatibility's sake with RATS.
	* Trivial change: shortened processing status phrase to
	  "Processing" so long filenames are more likely to fit on one line.
	* Modified the man page, in the hopes that the new one is even
	  easier to understand.

	* Released version 0.16.
	* Added support for directories.  If a directory (instead of a
	  file) is given on the command line as something to examine,
	  C/C++ files in that directory and its subdirectories (recursively)
	  are examined.  This should make it easy to analyze entire projects,
	  and to make it easy to integrate flawfinder into project websites.
	* Added to the vulnerability database: randomizing functions & getenv.
	* Reports the number of hits at the end.
	* Minor cleanup of text output.
	* Print "processing" status every time a file is opened; this is
	  flushed, so that monitoring the status with "less" works well.
	* Added the "--quiet" option, so that status information can be
	  suppressed.

	* Added support for file globbing on Windows/NT/DOS
	  (it's not needed for Cygwin - it's only needed when
	  run natively).  File globbing characters are
	  correctly ignored in Unix-like ("posix") systems, since
	  the Unix shell does this for us.

	* Fixed manual page to close the "/*" comment with "*/".

2001-05-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed a bug in directive handling, now directives work properly.
	  I only noticed this AFTER release of 0.14, sigh.
	* Fixed the ChangeLog, to note the addition of --neverignore.
	* Released version 0.15.

2001-05-29 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed a minor problem in string handling; a string containing
	  \\ followed immediately by the double-quote mark (end of the string)
	  wasn't correctly handled.  Now it is.
	* Added information in the documentation describing how to ignore
	  hits on a specific line (a comment directive).  Flawfinder has
	  always had this ability (since 0.12), but now it's documented.
	  Before, you had to read the test file test.c or the actual
	  flawfinder code to learn about this ability.
 	* Added the "--neverignore" / "-n" option.
	* Having a number of conversations with John Viega comparing
	  RATS and flawfinder, with the goal of finding a way to
	  coordinate and have a "best of breed" scanner.  This hasn't
	  produced a concrete result, but Viega will soon post a comparison
	  paper that I've had input on.
	* Released version 0.14.

2001-05-25 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Fixed a minor error in that parameter parser; previously it
	  might have trouble with embedded preprocessor commands in
	  the middle of parameter lists.
	* Added this ChangeLog.
	* Released version 0.13.

2001-05-21 David A. Wheeler <dwheeler, at, dwheeler.com>
	* Initial release of flawfinder version 0.12.
